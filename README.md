# END_TO_END-datascienceproject
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for a data science project:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Download and clean a housing dataset.

Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Split and scale the data.

2. Model Training:

Train a Random Forest Regressor model.

Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Save the trained model and scaler for later use.



3. API Deployment:

Build an API with FastAPI to serve predictions.

Use Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

Provide interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.
